For those with limited coding experience and those who want to learn these will outline some of the best practices to contributing to open source projects. We are aiming to teach best-practices to junior developers so that they are more familiar with work-flow when they reach industry. Members, if you have any questions feel free to message ```website``` channel in Slack for a quick response.
