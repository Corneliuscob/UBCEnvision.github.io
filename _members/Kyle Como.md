biography: >
  I am an undergraduate student in my 3rd year of Mechanical Engineering. My goal is to explore all of the exciting mechanical design options with my teammates and to produce prototypes. Before UBC I worked as a Mechanical Designer for 5 years. I have a diploma as a Mechanical Engineering Technologist in manufacturing from the BCIT and also as a Computer Automated Systems Technician from Thompson Rivers University. I will be conducting 3D modelling courses throughout the school year with the intent of manufacturing and prototyping.
