## Recruitment

### Lab Roles

We thank you for your interest but unfortunately, we won't be able to accommodate everyone for lab-based roles due to limited physical space. We currently do not have any openings for lab roles.

### Tech Roles

However, we are always looking for coders and developers to join our team! We welcome students from all backgrounds (engineering, arts, computer science etc.). If you're passionate about coding and committed to learning new digital trends and emerging technologies, we want you.
